# Applied Angular Labs

The purpose of these labs is to help you explore and deepen your understanding of the concepts presented in the class.

The purpose is _not_ to "get it done". Take your time and use this opportunity to work on your conceptual model of how to build applications in Angular.

Most importantly, be _honest_ with yourself and start wherever you feel would be most beneficial for you with your current skill and understanding level.

It is 100% ok if you just do the counter lab again. [Here is a video of me doing the counter lab. You can pause, rewind, whatever.](https://vimeo.com/1031643852/32215d8bcd)
